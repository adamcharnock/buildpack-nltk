# Warning: there are a few hacks in this script to accomidate excellent builds
# on Heroku. No gaurentee for external compatibility is made. However,
# everything should work fine outside of the Heroku environment, if the
# environment is setup correctly.

# Usage:
#
#     $ bin/compile <build-dir> <cache-dir> <env-path>
